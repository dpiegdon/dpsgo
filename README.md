GPS disciplined oscillator
==========================

Accurate frequency reference for measurement equipment.

A 10MHz OCXO is tuned to a timing signal of a GPS, e.g. the 1PPS output.
A frequency syntheziser then generates different signals from this
reference as needed/configured by the end user.


System components
-----------------

OCXO: refurbished 8663-XS with 10MHz output

DAC: AD5761R 16bit high quality low speed DAC with internal reference,
generates tuning signal for OCXO

GPS: uBlox NEO 7M module with 1PPS output

VCXO: Si5351-C frequency generator for programmable output frequencies

 * 10MHz reference output signal
 * 60MHz as test signal for the FPGA
 * other programmable outputs

FPGA: Lattice LP384: measures difference between the generated reference
output and the GPS reference signal. That information is used to
calculate the tuning voltage for the OCXO.

uC: nRF52840, STM32L063 or STM32F072 ??? as system and display
controller

Power input: 12V

PMIC: TPS652510 PMIC generating three rails of:

 * 1.2V FPGA core voltage (could be used for something else, as 1.2V can
   easily be generated by a MIC5365-1.2YC5)

 * 3.3V: digital logic

 * 10V: DAC

Display: SSD1306 ???

Interface: FT2232H, CP2102 or USB from the uC ???
